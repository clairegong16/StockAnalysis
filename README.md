# StockAnalysis
This primary purpose of this code is analyze the trends of stock prices (adjusted closed price) across the end of the year and the beginning of the year through the months December and January. It uses MSE or minimum mean error to estimate the trend line of the stock. 
I have also uploaded the generated data and graphs from my code. They come in three of the following types:
- raw data: the data from each company we specified that we based this project off of
- monthly graphs: a graph depicting the line of best of fit of the adjusted closed prices for a month that was generated from the the code
- scatter plot: a scatter plot depicting the line of best fit's slope of each year from the months December and January
